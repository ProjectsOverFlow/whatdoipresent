# What do I present?

> Yeah, but does it scale?

Noticing how most conference talks are all same bullshit, here's a long-awaited tool for generating talk titles.
Now you don't even have to think before call for papers! 

## Implementation

Uses Markov chains from real Devoxx talks. No, it's not reactive.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
